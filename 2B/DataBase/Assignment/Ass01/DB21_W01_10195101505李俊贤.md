## Chapter 03

### 3.11

- Find the ID and name of each student who has taken at least one Comp.
  Sci. course; make sure there are no duplicate names in the result.

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT ID, name
  FROM student NATURAL JOIN takes NATURAL JOIN course
  WHERE dept_name = 'Comp.Sci.';
  ```

- Find the ID and name of each student who has not taken any course
  offered before 2017.

  ```sql
  (SELECT ID, name
  FROM student NATURAL JOIN takes)
  EXCEPT
  (SELECT ID, name
  FROM student NATURAL JOIN takes
  WHERE year < 2017);
  ```

- For each department, find the maximum salary of instructors in that de-
  partment. You may assume that every department has at least one instruc-
  tor.

  ```sql
  SELECT dept_name, MAX(salary)
  FROM instructor
  GROUP BY dept_name;
  ```

- Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum
  salary computed by the preceding query.

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(max_salary)
  FROM (
  SELECT dept_name, MAX(salary)max_salary
  FROM instructor
  GROUP BY dept_name);
  ```

  

### 3.12

- Create a new course “CS-001”, titled “Weekly Seminar”, with 0 credits.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
  VALUES ('CS-001', 'Weekly Seminar', 'Comp.Sci.', 0);
  ```

- Create a section of this course in Fall 2017, with sec id of 1, and with the
  location of this section not yet specified.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO section(course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
  VALUES ('CS-001', 1, 'Fall', 2017);
  ```

- Enroll every student in the Comp.Sci. department in the above section.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO takes(ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
  SELECT ID, 'CS-001', 1, 'Fall', 2017
  FROM student
  WHERE dept_name = 'Comp.Sci.'
  ```

- Delete enrollments in the above section where the student’s ID is 12345.

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM takes
  WHERE (ID = 12345)
  	AND (course_id = 'CS-001')
  	AND (sec_id = 1)
  	AND (semester = 'Fall')
  	AND (year = 2017)
  ```

- Delete the course CS-001. What will happen if you run this delete state-
  ment without first deleting offerings (sections) of this course?

  
  
  All sections corresponding to the course 'CS-001' will be removed.
  
  
  
- Delete all takes tuples corresponding to any section of any course with
  the word “advanced” as a part of the title; ignore case when matching the
  word with the title.

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM takes
  WHERE course_id IN
  	(SELECT course_id
       FROM course
       WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%advanced%');
  ```

  

### 3.15

          	(SELECT branch_name
         		FROM branch
         		WHERE branch_city = 'Brooklyn'))));
  ```

  Answer
  ```sql
  WITH cust_bran
  (SELECT ID, customer_namem, branch_name FROM customer NATURAL JOIN depositor account)
  SELECT ID, customer FROM cust_bran cb1 WHERE NOT EXISTS(
    (SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM branch WHERE branch_city = 'Brooklyn')
    EXCEPT
    (SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM cust_bran cb2 WHERE cb1.ID = cb2.ID)
  )
  ```

                         WHERE manages.ID = S.ID
                 				 AND T.ID = S.ID);
  ```

  

- Find ID and name of each employee who earns more than the average
  salary of all employees of her or his company.

  FROM employee
  WHERE ID IN
  	(SELECT ID
  	FROM works
  	WHERE salary > avg(salary));
  ```

  

- Find the company that has the smallest payroll.

  ```sql
  WITH company_payroll(company_name, payroll)
  AS (SELECT company_name, sum(salary)
